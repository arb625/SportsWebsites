    <th align="left" valign="top" class="Normal" scope="col">Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport. Professional matches are played on an oval-shaped arena with a rectangular strip of land in the middle, known as the cricket pitch. Each team consists of two teams of 11 players each. One team bats first and the other bowls first. Whichever captain wins the coin toss before the game gets to decide whether his team will bat or bowl first. The batting team tries to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball with the bat and either running or hitting it to the rope, known as the boundary, around the arena. The bowling team tries to get each batsman out using various methods, the most common being bowled, leg before wicket, caught, and run out. After the teams finish the first innings, they switch batting and bowling. So if India bats first and Pakistan bowls first, then India bowls and Pakistan bats in the second innings. Whichever team gets the most runs in the given number of balls or before losing all their wickets, all their batsmen getting out, wins the game. </th>
