    <th align="left" valign="top" class="Normal" scope="col">India's 1983 cricket World Cup victory over the mighty West Indies is widely acknowledged as the defining moment in the history of Indian cricket. Under the spirited leadership of Kapil Dev, a determined Indian team exploited the English conditions to clinch the coveted title. As the news filtered through to the fans back home, it led to unprecedented scenes of jubilation throughout Delhi and Calcutta and the rest of the country. After this event, many people around the country started getting interested in cricket. This marked the rise of Indian cricket as well. Cricket was taken more seriously and the players were paid a higher salary. It is safe to assume that of India hadn't won this World Cup, they wouldn't be as good a team as they are now.</th>
