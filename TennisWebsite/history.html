  <h1>History of Tennis</h1>
  <p>The origins of can be  traced back to sometime between the 11th and 12th  centuries, when French monks started to play a game using their hands and a  cork and leather ball where they hit the ball over a piece of rope they tied.  This game was called “jeu de paume” which translated to “game of the hand.”  This rudimentary game would evolve to one of the most popular sports in the  world. Tennis’ popularity took off when nobility adopted the game from the  monks. Tennis spread through France very quickly.<br />
    The game continued rising in popularity and by the 13th  century, improvements and changes were made. The first racquet, a paddle with a  handle, was introduced. The game’s popularity took off in England as well. The  tennis courts in the 13th century were somewhere in the castle of  the royals who played it. The rules were very different and the balls could be  hit off walls. <br />
    In 1850, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber which led  to the introduction of a bouncy rubber tennis ball. This new kind of tennis  ball brought tennis outdoors and it made the sport start resembling modern  tennis.<br />
  In 1874, Major Walter Wingfield patented the equipment and rules  of tennis that are used today. The original court Wingfield designed was in the  shape of an hourglass which was not as big as the modern tennis court.  Obviously, his version of tennis courts and the rules he created underwent many  changes. All these improvements have led to the tennis we play today.   </p>
