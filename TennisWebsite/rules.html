  <h1>Rules of Tennis</h1>
  <p> The right to serve,  receive, choose your side, or give your opponent these choices is decided by a toss of a coin or  racquet. If the choice of service or receiver is chosen, the opponent chooses  which side to start. If not, it’s the other way around.<br />
    The <span class="vocab">server</span> is the  player who delivers the ball and the <span class="vocab">receiver</span> is the one who gets it. The  server serves the first point from his right-hand side. The server alternates  between serving from right and left of the middle of the baseline every point  so that all even number points are played on the<span class="vocab"> deuce court</span> (the right) and  all odd number points are played on the <span class="vocab">advantage court</span> (the left). When  serving from his right, the server must hit the ball into the square box on the  left side of the opposite court and when serving from his left, he must hit it  in the right box. If the server commits two faults, which is when he misses the  box or hits the net, or if he commits a foot fault by stepping on the baseball  before making contact with the ball, he loses the point. If the ball hits the  net on a serve and then falls in the correct box, the server is granted another  serve. If the receiver hits the ball before it bounces, the server  automatically wins the point.<br />
    When a point is  being played out, if someone hits the ball into the net or if they hit it out  of the big rectangle (not including the two alleys in singles and including  them in doubles), they lose the point. If the ball hits any part of the outer  lines of the rectangle, it is in. If the ball hits the net and goes onto the  other side, unless it’s a serve, the ball is in play. A player automatically  loses the point if he touches the net during a point.      <br />
    The server is  responsible for calling out the score. He calls out his score followed by the  opponents’ score. At the beginning of every game, each player starts out with  zero points, which is called Love. Whichever player wins the first point gets a  score of 15. From there it goes to 30, then 40, and then if the player wins  another point, he wins the game. However, if the score is tied at 40-40, or  deuce, then the player who wins the next points is given advantage and the  score becomes Ad-40. The player with advantage must win the next point also to  win the game. If he loses it, the score is back to deuce. The player to win six  games with a lead of two or more wins the set. If the game count is 6-6, the  players play a tiebreaker, where they alternate serves every two points after  the first point and the first to 7 points wins the set. A player must win 2  sets out of 3 or 3 out of 5 to win the whole match.</p>
